# Welcome to the Malum Widget Version 1.0

I made this widget for anyone that plays Malum. Note, this uses StreamElements, but the StreamElements chat bot is not required to be in chat, you just need to link your Twitch Account to StreamElements.
This widget was created as a fork of GlitchedMythos's Phasmophobia Widget V3.0, which can be found [at this link](https://github.com/GlitchedMythos/se-widgets/tree/main/phasmophobia_evidence_v3). Thank you GlitchedMythos for fostering a wonderful community!

I made this widget for anyone who uses StreamElements that plays Phasmophobia. To see how the widget works, please click the video below:
