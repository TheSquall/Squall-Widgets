# Welcome to the Malum BETA Widget version 0.1.0

I made this widget for anyone who uses StreamElements that plays Malum.
This widget was created as a fork of GlitchedMythos's Phasmophobia Widget V3.0, which can be found [at this link](https://github.com/GlitchedMythos/se-widgets/tree/main/phasmophobia_evidence_v3).

An installation and usage YouTube video will be generated as this Widget goes to release.

# Please Do Not share This Widget URL with ANYONE until Ready for Release. This Widget is being provided as a closed beta to specific users of the Twitch and Malum community.
